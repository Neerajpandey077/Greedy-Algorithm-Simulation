# Greedy Algorithm Simulation

This project is a web-based simulator for understanding Greedy Algorithms,
developed as part of a Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) project.

## Algorithms Covered
- Activity Selection
- Fractional Knapsack
- Coin Change (Greedy)
- (More coming soon)

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any browser

## Purpose
To visually understand how greedy algorithms make optimal choices at each step.
